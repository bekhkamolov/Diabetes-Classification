# Diabetes-Classification
In this project I tried to predict whether the patient has diabets or not in two different way: using a simple interpretable model(DecisionTreeClassifier) and using black box model (RandomForestClassifier). This open source dataset consists of 8 attributes and one label column Outcome

At first I did some EDA (exploratory data analysis) to get familiar with columns, checking the missing values.
